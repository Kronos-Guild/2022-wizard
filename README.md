# 2022 Wizard

> Web-based generator for secure, production-ready Anchor programs from audited building blocks.

Inspired by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), 2022 Wizard lets Solana developers assemble programs by selecting pre-audited modules, configuring options through a visual interface, and exporting a complete Anchor project ready for deployment.

---

## Why

Writing secure Solana programs from scratch is error-prone and time-consuming. Common patterns—ownership, access control, account validation—are reimplemented (and mis-implemented) in every project. 2022 Wizard solves this by:

- Providing **audited building blocks** with secure defaults
- Enabling **visual composition** so developers see exactly what they're shipping
- Exporting **production-ready Anchor projects** with tests and configuration included

---

## Security Disclaimer

The code generated by 2022 Wizard is assembled from audited building blocks and follows security best practices. However:

- **You are responsible for reviewing all generated code** before deployment.
- Audited blocks reduce risk but do not eliminate it—your specific configuration and any custom logic must still be tested.
- Always run a full test suite and consider an independent audit for mainnet deployments.

## Planned / On Deck

### Core Features
- [ ] **Basic Mint Creation** — name, symbol, decimals, initial supply
- [ ] **Metadata Extension** — store token info on-chain (Token-2022 metadata extension)

### Optional Extensions (User Toggles)
- [ ] **Transfer Fee** — charge fees on transfers (configurable basis points)
- [ ] **Close Mint** — allow mint authority to close mint and reclaim rent
- [ ] **Non-Transferable** — soulbound tokens for badges, achievements, credentials

### Wizard Flow
- [ ] Configure token via UI controls
- [ ] Live code preview with diff view
- [ ] Export complete Anchor project (.zip)

### Output
- [ ] Anchor project structure (programs/, tests/, Anchor.toml, package.json)
- [ ] Generated IDL
- [ ] Local validator scripts
- [ ] Deployment checklist

## Supported Output (Milestone 1)

**Anchor-only**

| Dependency | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Anchor     | 0.30+   |
| Solana CLI | 1.18+   |
| Rust       | 1.75+   |
| Node       | 20+     |

Native program export is planned for a future milestone.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the wizard.

## Roadmap

1. **MVP** — Core wizard flow with 2-3 module types, Anchor export
2. **Beta** — Expanded module library, GitHub export, shareable configs
3. **Audited Catalog** — Formal audits for all building blocks, versioned releases
4. **Native Export** — Optional native (non-Anchor) program generation
